Each UI Framework has its own specifications and requirements such as building HTML markup in a specific way, including specific resource files/ javascripts etc.

So, as a developer it makes hard to migrate from one framework to other.

The goal of this project is to make a Universal Interface for all the frameworks thereby making the transition between UI Frameworks smooth.

Goals Of the Project
--------------------
- to create a generic theme framework, that can handle the diversity in themes
- to create backend language bindings (Rails, node, Java, Go..) for UI frameworks

Short term goals
------------------
- to create a ruby gem that could be used with `rails` to switch between multiple themes
